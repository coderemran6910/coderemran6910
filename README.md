## About Me
I'm a passionate MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack developer with expertise in several technologies:

#### React üöÄ
I love working with React to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Whether it's crafting components or managing state with Redux or Context API, React is my go-to framework!

#### Tailwind CSS üíÖ
Tailwind CSS is my preferred choice for crafting sleek and modern UIs. Its utility-first approach combined with custom configurations helps me create beautiful designs efficiently.

#### Express.js üåê
With Express.js, I handle server-side logic effortlessly. From routing to middleware and APIs, Express simplifies backend development for me.

#### Firebase üî•
Firebase is my go-to platform for backend-as-a-service (BaaS). Its real-time database, authentication, and hosting services streamline my development process.

### What Drives Me üöÄ
I'm passionate about creating scalable web applications that offer seamless user experiences. Constantly learning and exploring new technologies, I aim to build innovative solutions that make a positive impact.
